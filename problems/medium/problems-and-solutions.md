# MEDIUM DIFFICULTY PROBLEMS

## Problem 1: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. We return [1, 2].

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. We return [1, 3].

Constraints:
- 2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 10^4
- -1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000
- numbers is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- -1000 <= target <= 1000

Solution:
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        left, right = 0, len(numbers) - 1
        
        while left < right:
            current_sum = numbers[left] + numbers[right]
            
            if current_sum == target:
                return [left + 1, right + 1]  # 1-indexed
            elif current_sum < target:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        
        return []  # Should never reach here given constraints

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


## Problem 2: 3Sum

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Explanation: 
nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2] = (-1) + 0 + 1 = 0.
nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[4] = 0 + 1 + (-1) = 0.
The distinct triplets are [-1,0,1] and [-1,-1,2].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,1]
Output: []
Explanation: The only possible triplet does not sum up to 0.

Constraints:
- 3 <= nums.length <= 3000
- -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5

Solution:
class Solution:
    def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        nums.sort()
        result = []
        
        for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
            # Skip duplicates for first number
            if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue
                
            left, right = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
            
            while left < right:
                current_sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]
                
                if current_sum == 0:
                    result.append([nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]])
                    
                    # Skip duplicates
                    while left < right and nums[left] == nums[left + 1]:
                        left += 1
                    while left < right and nums[right] == nums[right - 1]:
                        right -= 1
                        
                    left += 1
                    right -= 1
                elif current_sum < 0:
                    left += 1
                else:
                    right -= 1
                    
        return result

Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding output array


## Problem 3: Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container that can hold the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

Example 1:
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example 2:
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1

Constraints:
- n == height.length
- 2 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 <= height[i] <= 10^4

Solution:
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(height) - 1
        max_area = 0
        
        while left < right:
            width = right - left
            current_area = min(height[left], height[right]) * width
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
            
            # Move the pointer with smaller height
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
                
        return max_area

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)


## Problem 4: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.

Constraints:
- 0 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4
- s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_set = set()
        left = 0
        max_length = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in char_set:
                char_set.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            
            char_set.add(s[right])
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
            
        return max_length

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(min(m,n)) where m is the size of charset


## Problem 5: Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Example 1:
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

Example 2:
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]

Example 3:
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]

Constraints:
- 1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagram_map = {}
        
        for s in strs:
            # Sort the string to create a key
            key = ''.join(sorted(s))
            
            if key not in anagram_map:
                anagram_map[key] = []
            
            anagram_map[key].append(s)
        
        return list(anagram_map.values())

Alternative Solution (Character Count):
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        anagram_map = {}
        
        for s in strs:
            # Create character count array
            count = [0] * 26
            for c in s:
                count[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
            
            key = tuple(count)
            
            if key not in anagram_map:
                anagram_map[key] = []
            
            anagram_map[key].append(s)
        
        return list(anagram_map.values())

Time Complexity: O(n * k log k) where n is number of strings and k is max length
Space Complexity: O(n * k)


## Problem 6: Product of Array Except Self

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]

Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

Constraints:
- 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

Solution:
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        result = [1] * n
        
        # Calculate left products
        for i in range(1, n):
            result[i] = result[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
        
        # Calculate right products and multiply with left products
        right_product = 1
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            result[i] *= right_product
            right_product *= nums[i]
        
        return result

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1) excluding output array
