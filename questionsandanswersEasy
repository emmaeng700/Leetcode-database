Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1

Answer
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        l = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i]:
                nums[i],nums[l] = nums[l],nums[i]
                l+=1

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,2]
Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
-100 <= nums[i] <= 100
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Answer:
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0

        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:
                l+=1
                nums[l] = nums[i]
                

        return l+1

Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 104
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 

Follow up: Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an O(n) solution using a different approach?

Answer:
class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        ans = [0] * len(nums)
        n = len(nums)-1

        while n >=0:
            lsq = nums[l] ** 2
            rsq = nums[r] ** 2

            if lsq > rsq:
                ans[n] = lsq
                l+=1

            else:
                ans[n] = rsq
                r-=1


            n-=1
        
        return ans

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

Answer:
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        l = 0
        r = len(s) - 1

        while l < r:
            s[l], s[r] = s[r], s[l]
            l+=1
            r-=1

Given two strings s and t, return true if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. '#' means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "ac".
Example 2:

Input: s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"
Output: true
Explanation: Both s and t become "".
Example 3:

Input: s = "a#c", t = "b"
Output: false
Explanation: s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200
s and t only contain lowercase letters and '#' characters.
 

Follow up: Can you solve it in O(n) time and O(1) space?

Answer:
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def build(string: str) -> str:
            stk = []
            for char in string:
                if char == "#":
                    if stk:
                        stk.pop()

                else:
                    stk.append(char)

            return ''.join(stk)

        
        return build(s) == build(t)

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

Answer:
class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        n = len(needle)
        h = len(haystack)

        for i in range(h-(n-1)):
            if haystack[i:i+n] == needle:
                return i 

        return -1

Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.
Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 100
0 <= nums[i] <= 50
0 <= val <= 100

Answer
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums: List[int], val: int) -> int:
        l = 0

        for i in range(len(nums)):
            if nums[i] != val:
                nums[l] = nums[i]
                l+=1

        return l

A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.
Example 2:

Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 2 * 105
s consists only of printable ASCII characters.

Answer:
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        filtstr = ''.join([char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()])
        l = 0
        r = len(filtstr)-1

        while l < r:
            if filtstr[l] != filtstr[r]:
                return False

            l+=1
            r-=1

        return True

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
Output: [1,2,2,3,5,6]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [1,2,2,3,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
Output: [1]
Explanation: The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
 

Constraints:

nums1.length == m + n
nums2.length == n
0 <= m, n <= 200
1 <= m + n <= 200
-109 <= nums1[i], nums2[j] <= 109
 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?

Answer
class Solution:
    def merge(self, nums1: List[int], m: int, nums2: List[int], n: int) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums1 in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(n):
            nums1[m+i] = nums2[i]

        nums1.sort()

Given a binary string s, return the number of non-empty substrings that have the same number of 0's and 1's, and all the 0's and all the 1's in these substrings are grouped consecutively.

Substrings that occur multiple times are counted the number of times they occur.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "00110011"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 substrings that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's: "0011", "01", "1100", "10", "0011", and "01".
Notice that some of these substrings repeat and are counted the number of times they occur.
Also, "00110011" is not a valid substring because all the 0's (and 1's) are not grouped together.
Example 2:

Input: s = "10101"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 substrings: "10", "01", "10", "01" that have equal number of consecutive 1's and 0's.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either '0' or '1'.

Answer:
class Solution:
    def countBinarySubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        curr = 1
        prev = 0
        ans = 0

        for i in range(1,len(s)):
            if s[i-1] == s[i]:
                curr += 1

            else:
                ans += min(prev,curr)
                prev = curr
                curr = 1

        return ans + min(prev,curr)
